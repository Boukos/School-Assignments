Project: Lab 0
==========

An introductory lab assignment, students were instructed to 
make an parsing function, a usage message function, define enumerations,
and get a general feel for the structure of C++ programs.

All of this courses labs will be compounded on the previous,
so often changes will occur to recurring header and source files
to be used in future laboratory assignments.
