CSE 241 is Data Structures and Algorithms, a few programming assignments were assigned.  

Various topics were covered, including Divide and Conquer, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming algorithms,
sorting algorithms, graph algorithms (shortest path, minimum spanning tree, etc), binary heap priority queues,
 skip lists, asymptotic running time, and more.

I received an A in this course.
